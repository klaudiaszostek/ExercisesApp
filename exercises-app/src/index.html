      <h3>How do you reconcile this with your studies?</h3>
      <p>👍 If you have a busy week → 3 training days instead of 4</p>
      <p>
        👍 If you don't have a gym → strength training at home with your own
        body weight
      </p>
      <p>
        👍 If you don't have time for cardio → more walking (e.g. stairs instead
        of elevator, walk to university)
